## Prerequisites
This set of instructions requires that docker is already installed and docker commands can be run from a bash shell or a command line. You can get more information at the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)

**Note:** This lab assumes that you have already installed Docker on your laptop or you are using a Linux VM provided by the instructor. So you have 2 possibilities:

- Docker is already installed on your **laptop**
- Docker is already installed on the **provided VM** by the instructor

Follow one or the other possibility.



## Task 1 - Working with Docker



### 1. Check Docker version

Launch a shell or a command line and confirm that docker is installed.

The version number isn't particularly important.
However, you can see both the client (CLI) and the server (engine).

`docker version`

Output:

```bash
# docker version
Client: Docker Engine - Community
 Version:           18.09.1
 API version:       1.39
 Go version:        go1.10.6
 Git commit:        4c52b90
 Built:             Wed Jan  9 19:33:12 2019
 OS/Arch:           darwin/amd64
 Experimental:      false

Server: Docker Engine - Community
 Engine:
  Version:          18.09.1
  API version:      1.39 (minimum version 1.12)
  Go version:       go1.10.6
  Git commit:       4c52b90
  Built:            Wed Jan  9 19:41:49 2019
  OS/Arch:          linux/amd64
  Experimental:     true
```

The Docker version could be different. 

If you receive an error then go back to the **PrepareLab.md** document to install Docker on your system. 



### 2. Run your first container

As with all new computer things, it is obligatory that we start with "hello-world"

`docker run hello-world`

Output:

```bash
# docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
1b930d010525: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:2557e3c07ed1e38f26e389462d03ed943586f744621577a99efb77324b0fe535
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
```

   

 > Notice the message `Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally` First you see that the image was automatically downloaded without any additional commands. Second the version `:latest` was added to the name of the image. We did not specify a version for this image.



### 3. Rerun "hello-world" 

Notice that the image is not pulled down again. It already exists locally, so it is run.

`docker run hello-world`

Output:

```bash
# docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
```




### 4.  Show the image

List all the images:

 `docker images hello-world`

Output:

```bash
# docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hello-world         latest              fce289e99eb9        3 weeks ago         1.84kB
```




### 5. From where was the `hello-world` image pulled? 

Go to `https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world/` and you can read about this image. Docker-hub is a registry that holds docker images for use. Docker-hub is not the only registry, IBM Cloud Public can serve as a docker registry. You can also have (or define) private registries.

![dockerHub](./images/dockerhubhello.png) 



### 6. Run a new container

This image is a typical image to get started with Docker. When an image is run it usually continues to run. 

The running image is called a **container**. Let us run a more typical image; This image contains the noSQL database **couchDB**. As there is no image containing couchDB on your laptop, you will first pull it from the Docker Hub and then once all the layers have been downloaded and extracted, you will run it.

`docker run -d couchdb`

Output:

```bash
# docker run -d couchdb
Unable to find image 'couchdb:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/couchdb
5e6ec7f28fb7: Downloading [===========================>                       ]  12.17MB/22.5MB
70113ec2139e: Download complete 
80648cf0a24a: Download complete 
e0794329addc: Download complete 
6d60e1d083fc: Download complete 
708127226509: Download complete 
4eddfd85791c: Downloading [==========>                                        ]  11.24MB/54.15MB

c7df822199b0: Download complete 
ca2c2d17695c: Download complete 
dbb7188da17c: Download complete 
```

 The output above was captured while the image was still downloading from docker-hub. When the download is complete,  you don't see anything from the container, like with hello-world. Instead you see a long hex id like `272d409a806c485cfe83727f895093ee2fcd586a6cf98455e6216c9fc95af24d`. **This is the long id of the container**.

```bash
Digest: sha256:7f3e6372ff8a87f1a11c63a787ec7dceda85a8fe80005d6c5bbdfa6a6bcde73e
Status: Downloaded newer image for couchdb:latest
272d409a806c485cfe83727f895093ee2fcd586a6cf98455e6216c9fc95af24d
```

Also notice that the -d in the run command with launch the container as **detached** and so you can get the prompt and the command has been completed.



### 7. Look at the running container

Notice only the first part of that long hex id is displayed. Typically this is more than enough to uniquely identify that container. `docker ps` provides information about when the container was created, how long it has been running, then name of the image as well as the name of the container. Note that each container must have a unique name. You can specify a name for each container as long as it is unique.

`docker ps | grep couchdb` 

Output:

```bash
# docker ps               
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                          NAMES
272d409a806c        couchdb             "tini -- /docker-ent…"   3 minutes ago       Up 3 minutes        4369/tcp, 5984/tcp, 9100/tcp   xenodochial_heisenberg
```

You will notice that the name is auto-generated by Docker:  **xenodochial_heisenberg**. So to avoid this, a good practice is to always give a name to a container with the **--name** parameter.




### 8. An image can be run multiple times 

Launch another container for the couchdb image.

`docker run -d couchdb`
Output:

```bash
# docker run -d couchdb
fd511f9cd8965395bfcb652d6a10b5eec5c0b4479950064d7e238420c8099a6b
```

Did you notice how quickly the second instance started? There was no need to download the image this time. The id of the container is show after is has started. You can notice that we are reusing all the layers already downloaded when we first pull the image.



### 9. Two couchDB containers  

`docker ps | grep couchdb`

Outpout:

```bash
# docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                          NAMES
fd511f9cd896        couchdb             "tini -- /docker-ent…"   4 minutes ago       Up 4 minutes        4369/tcp, 5984/tcp, 9100/tcp   cocky_jones
272d409a806c        couchdb             "tini -- /docker-ent…"   13 minutes ago      Up 13 minutes       4369/tcp, 5984/tcp, 9100/tcp   xenodochial_heisenberg
```




### 10. Similar couchDB instances 

The containers look similar, but they have unique names and unique ids. 

Stop the most recent container and then check to see what's running.

`docker stop fd511f9cd896 `

Output:

```bash
# docker stop fd511f9cd896
fd511f9cd896
```

Then check the container list:

`docker ps | grep couchdb`or `docker ps`

Output:

```bash
# docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                          NAMES
272d409a806c        couchdb             "tini -- /docker-ent…"   19 minutes ago      Up 19 minutes       4369/tcp, 5984/tcp, 9100/tcp   xenodochial_heisenberg
```

So we still have one running container.

​    


### 11. Stop the other container

Stop the other container and see what is running.

 `docker stop 272d409a806c`

 `docker ps | grep couchdb` or `docker ps`

Output:

```bash
# docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

We have no more couchDB running constainer.

 

### 12. What about the images

 Notice that the images still exist.

 `docker images`

Output:

```bash
# docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
couchdb             latest              3bfb066ff4c5        19 hours ago        205MB
hello-world         latest              fce289e99eb9        3 weeks ago         1.84kB
```

>  You can filter the images by they names : `docker images couchdb`   

  

### 13. Now remove the couchDB image 

Go ahead and delete the couchDB image and double check that it is gone.

` docker rmi couchdb`

Output:

```bash
# docker rmi couchdb
Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to remove repository reference "couchdb" (must force) - container 272d409a806c is using its referenced image 3bfb066ff4c5

```

Apparently some stopped containers are still using this images and you can see the ids.

   

### 14. Oops, it is not working

We can't delete that image until we delete the "couchdb" containers (running or not).

> Note the `docker ps -a` will show us all the containers, not just the ones that are running but also the ones that stopped.
You will noticed that all containers that you are listing have been stopped. 

`docker ps -a | grep couchdb`

Output:

```bash
# docker ps -a | grep couchdb
fd511f9cd896        couchdb             "tini -- /docker-ent…"   21 minutes ago      Exited (0) 11 minutes ago                       cocky_jones
272d409a806c        couchdb             "tini -- /docker-ent…"   29 minutes ago      Exited (0) 7 minutes ago                        xenodochial_heisenberg

```

 

### 15. How to remove the image

Delete the stopped couchdb containers, delete the couchdb image, and make sure it is gone. You can leave hello-world.

`docker rm fd511f9cd896 272d409a806c `
Output:

```bash
# docker rm fd511f9cd896 272d409a806c
fd511f9cd896
272d409a806c
```

And use the rmi subcommand to remove the image:

 `docker rmi couchdb`

Output:

```bash
# docker rmi couchdb
Untagged: couchdb:latest
Untagged: couchdb@sha256:7f3e6372ff8a87f1a11c63a787ec7dceda85a8fe80005d6c5bbdfa6a6bcde73e

Notice that all the layers in the image have been gone.  

`docker images -a | grep couchdb`

***Note:*** Docker images and containers can be referenced by **name** or by **id**. 



## Task 2: Building Docker Images

A Dockerfile is a text file that has a series of instructions on how to build your image. It supports a simple set of commands that you need to use in your Dockerfile. There are several commands supported like FROM, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, VOLUME, ENV and more. We shall look at some of them.

Let us first start with the the overall flow, which goes something like this:

1. You create a Dockerfile with the required instructions.
2. Then you will use the docker build command to create a Docker image based on the Dockerfile that you created in step 1.

With this information, let us get going.



### 1. Our First Dockerfile

First let's create a directory:

`mkdir images`

`cd images`

`nano Dockerfile`or `notepad Dockerfile` 

Now type the following 2 lines:

```
FROM busybox:latest
MAINTAINER yourname
```

Replace **yourname** with your name. 

Since, a Docker image is nothing but a series of layers built on top of each other, we start with a base image. The FROM command sets the base image for the rest of the instructions. The MAINTAINER command tells who is the author of the generated images. This is a good practice. You could have taken any other base image in the FROM instruction too, for e.g. ubuntu:latest or ubunt:14.04, etc.

**Busybox** is just the set of most of the shell commands. A very light subset of Linux. Busybox as an image has not been pulled yet.

Now, **save** the file and come back to the prompt (ctrl O, enter, ctrl X) for nano.

Execute the following in the /images folder as shown below (don't forget the **dot** at the end):

`docker build -t myimage:latest .`

Result: 
``` bash
# docker build -t myimage:latest .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.048kB
Step 1/2 : FROM busybox:latest
latest: Pulling from library/busybox
57c14dd66db0: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:7964ad52e396a6e045c39b5a44438424ac52e12e4d5a25d94895f2058cb863a0
Status: Downloaded newer image for busybox:latest
 ---> 3a093384ac30
Step 2/2 : MAINTAINER yourname
 ---> Running in 97df43af5cdb
Removing intermediate container 97df43af5cdb
 ---> e50f1efaafdc
Successfully built e50f1efaafdc
Successfully tagged myimage:latest
```
This command is used to build a Docker image. The parameters that we have passed are:

- -t is the Docker image tag. You can give a name to your image and a tag.
- The second parameter (a ‘.’) specifies the location of the Dockerfile that we created. Since we created the Dockerfile in the same folder in which we are running the docker build, we specified the current directory.

Notice the various steps that the build process goes through to build out your image.

If you run a docker images command now, you will see the myimage image listed in the output as shown below:

`docker images`

```bash
# docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
myimage             latest              e50f1efaafdc        4 minutes ago       1.2MB
hello-world         latest              fce289e99eb9        3 weeks ago         1.84kB
busybox             latest              3a093384ac30        3 weeks ago         1.2MB
```

You can notice that we have pulled busybox image and created myimage ! The images are very tiny.

You can now launch a container, any time via the standard docker run command:

`docker run -it myimage`

```bash
# docker run -it myimage
/ # ls
bin   dev   etc   home  proc  root  sys   tmp   usr   var
/ # ps
PID   USER     TIME  COMMAND
    1 root      0:00 sh
    8 root      0:00 ps
/ # exit
```

We are entering into the myimage shell (-it parameter). And you can use any shell commands like ls or ps inside the container. Type ***exit*** to come back to the standard shell.

`nano Dockerfile`or `notepad Dockerfile` 

```console
FROM busybox:latest
MAINTAINER yourname
CMD ["date"]
```

Then build and run the myimage container:

`docker build -t myimage:latest .`

`docker run -it myimage`

```bash
# docker run -it myimage
Mon Apr 16 12:44:10 UTC 2018
```


The CMD instruction takes various forms and when it is used individually in the file without the ENTRYPOINT command (which we will see in a while), it takes the following format:

`CMD ["executable","param1","param2"]`

So in our case, we provided the date command as the executable and when we ran a container based on the myimage now, it printed out the data.

In fact, while launching the container, you can override the default CMD by providing it at the command line as shown below. In this example, we are saying to launch the shell , thereby overriding the default CMD instruction for the Docker Image. Notice that it will lead us into the shell.

Change your Dockerfile to the following:

```console
FROM busybox
MAINTAINER myname
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/cat"]
CMD ["/etc/passwd"]
```

Save, **Build** and re-rerun myimage. 

`docker build -t myimage:latest .`

`docker run -it myimage`

```bash
# docker run -it myimage
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/false
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/false
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/false
sync:x:4:100:sync:/bin:/bin/sync
mail:x:8:8:mail:/var/spool/mail:/bin/false
www-data:x:33:33:www-data:/var/www:/bin/false
operator:x:37:37:Operator:/var:/bin/false
nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/home:/bin/false
```




### 2. Building a web server


Now, let us look at another Dockerfile shown below:

```console
FROM ubuntu
MAINTAINER Philippe
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y nginx
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/sbin/nginx","-g","daemon off;"]
EXPOSE 80
```

Here, what we are building is an image that will run the nginx proxy server for us. Look at the set of instructions and it should be pretty clear. After the standard FROM and MAINTAINER instructions, we are executing a couple of RUN instructions. A RUN instruction is used to execute any commands during the **build** process. In this case we are running a package update and then installing nginx. The ENTRYPOINT is then running the nginx executable and we are using the EXPOSE command here to inform what port the container will be listening on. Remember in our earlier chapters, we saw that if we use the -P command, then the EXPOSE port will be used by default. However, you can always change the host port via the -p parameter as needed.

Here are the steps:

`cd`

`mkdir webapp`

`cd webapp`

`nano Dockerfile` or `notepad Dockerfile`

Now copy and paste the Dockerfile text (see above). Save the file.

`docker build . -t myimage:latest`

`docker run -d -p 8081:80 --name webserver myimage`

To use your application, you have 3 possibilities:

You can use **curl**:

`curl http://localhost:8081`

Results :

```bash
# curl http://localhost:8081
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>

###3. Troubleshooting containers  

To troubleshoot your container or your application, you may want to go inside the container to look at some logs or to see the processes.

`docker exec -it webserver "/bin/bash"`

> -it : this concerns the interation with the container by using a bash shell.
>
> A prompt with the container id will be returned to you like : **root@cc88b7536a57:/#**
>
> You can then type any kind of linux commands that are parts of the image.

Output:

```bash
# docker exec -it webserver "/bin/bash"
root@cc88b7536a57:/# 
root@cc88b7536a57:/# 
root@cc88b7536a57:/# ll
